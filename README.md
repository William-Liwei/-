## I. Background
With the rapid development of information technology, the education industry is undergoing unprecedented changes. In the field of higher education, course selection is an important part of students' academic planning, but traditional course selection systems have many problems, such as difficult course selection, tiring course grabbing, and even the emergence of bad phenomena such as course buying and selling. To solve these problems, we designed and implemented "CourseWing", a website deployed on Tianyi Cloud Server based on Playwright and Flask, aiming to simplify the course selection process, improve students' course selection experience, and promote the rational allocation of educational resources.
## II. Detailed Analysis of the Difficulties in Course Selection
The difficulty in course selection is the result of the interplay of multiple factors. First, the limited resources of college courses, especially popular courses, often cannot meet the needs of students, leading to a widespread phenomenon of insufficient supply. Secondly, the existence of technical barriers makes it difficult for some students to complete the course selection operation quickly during the course selection peak period, missing the desired courses. Moreover, the problem of network congestion further exacerbates the difficulty of course selection. When the course selection system is open, a large number of students log in at the same time, causing the server load to be too heavy, and the web page loads slowly or even crashes, seriously affecting the smooth progress of course selection.
This unfair distribution of educational resources not only affects students' academic development but also disrupts the harmony and stability of the educational ecosystem to a certain extent. In addition, the phenomenon of course grabbing has also given rise to a series of improper behaviors, such as course buying and selling, and malicious seat occupation, which seriously violate the original intention and ethical morals of education, and have a negative impact on the long-term development of schools.
## III. System Architecture
The front-end architecture of "CourseWing" adopts a responsive design to adapt to the screen sizes and resolutions of different devices, ensuring that users can have a consistent experience on any device. The front-end interface is built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, which not only ensures the modernity and interactivity of the page but also makes the page load faster and the user experience better. The system achieves real-time data updates and dynamic interaction, allowing users to see the changes in the course selection status immediately without refreshing the page, greatly improving the convenience of operation.
The backend architecture is based on the Flask framework, which is lightweight and flexible, making it very suitable for handling HTTP requests and routing distribution. SQLAlchemy is used for database operations, which provides a high-level ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, making database operations more intuitive and secure. Playwright is used to perform automated tasks, such as simulating user login, course selection, etc., improving the automation level of the system. In addition, the backend also integrates deep learning models to achieve sentiment analysis of comments, which not only improves the intelligence level of the system but also brings a richer interactive experience to users.
## IV. Core Functional Modules
1. Intelligent Course Selection System
The intelligent course selection system is one of the core functions of "CourseWing", which is implemented through the rob_course() function. It supports multi-course concurrent course selection and can handle course selection requests under high concurrency. The system has a timing course selection function, allowing users to preset the course selection time, and the system will automatically perform the course selection operation, greatly facilitating users. At the same time, the system can automatically identify the course status, such as whether the course is full or conflicts, and promptly send email notifications to users about the course selection results, improving the success rate of course selection and user experience.
2. User Management System
The user management system is another core module of "CourseWing", which is implemented through the User class. The system provides users with a level system and experience points system, allowing users to accumulate experience points and improve their level by participating in community activities and publishing comments. In addition, the system also provides avatar management functions, allowing users to upload personalized avatars to enhance personal identification. Social interaction functions allow users to interact with each other, such as liking and commenting, enhancing the activity of the community.
3. Comment System and AI Analysis
The comment system and AI analysis module are implemented through the SentimentAnalyzer class, which integrates a sentiment analysis model and can analyze the emotional tendency of user comments, providing multi-dimensional evaluation indicators. The system can also visualize the analysis results, allowing users to intuitively understand the popularity and pros and cons of courses. The intelligent comment recommendation function recommends relevant comment content to users based on their historical behavior and preferences, improving users' participation and satisfaction.
## V. Technological Innovation Points
"CourseWing" has achieved significant results in technological innovation. The system integrates the RoBERTa model for comment sentiment analysis, which is an advanced natural language processing model capable of accurately identifying and analyzing the emotional tendency in text data. Through this technology, the system can achieve multi-dimensional course evaluation analysis, provide intelligent comment summaries and recommendations, greatly enrich the interactive experience of users, and provide data support for course improvement.
"CourseWing" has also achieved significant results in automation technology. The system uses Playwright's headless browser operation to simulate users' course selection behavior, including login, course selection, score checking, etc., greatly improving the automation level of course selection. Intelligent captcha processing technology enables the system to automatically recognize and process captchas, reducing the user's operational burden. In addition, the system has achieved multi-threaded concurrent course selection, improving the efficiency and success rate of course selection.
To enhance user experience, "CourseWing" has introduced a user level and experience points system to encourage users to actively participate in community activities. The real-time email notification function ensures that users can promptly understand their course selection status and system dynamics. Personalized data display shows customized information and recommendations based on users' behavior and preferences, improving users' satisfaction and loyalty.
## VI. System Performance
In terms of concurrent processing, "CourseWing" uses thread locks to ensure data consistency and avoid data conflicts that may occur during multi-threaded operations. By implementing the model singleton pattern, the system reduces the creation and destruction of objects, improving performance. At the same time, the system has also optimized database query efficiency, using indexing, query optimization, and other technologies to improve data processing speed and ensure the stable operation of the system under high concurrency.
Another important aspect of system performance is error handling. "CourseWing" has a comprehensive exception handling mechanism that can capture and handle various exceptions, ensuring the stable operation of the system. The log recording system records key information during the system operation, facilitating problem tracing and analysis. The automatic retry mechanism automatically re-executes the operation when encountering temporary errors, improving the robustness of the system.
